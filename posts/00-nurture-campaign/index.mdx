RUBYâ€™S
TiMESHiP 4

IT'S A GREAT GATSBY FUNCTION

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge, where
we start our story.

Sunny summer is coming, but
the sneakiest sister is secretly
on the verge of starting up a civil war.
A civil war that can be blamed on
her half sisters and all the other
front end engineers.

Ruby Reckless, the youngest
half sister suspects nothing,
before seeing her beloved sister
Lizabeth loose laughter and liberty
for her front end engineering ways.

Ruby recklessly runs
duct taped code and
escapes alone to the far future and
teams up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess.

To learn the real ropes of
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comback in 1554

But when the
Tower of London
jail break fails
in flames
Ruby must learn to
LiVE code.
A great Gatsby function,
must work
before Lizabeth is beheaded.

Or Ruby will fail to stop
half sister Queen
murderous Mary from
re-building London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.
And replace all the
nice neighbours with
bad back end engineers

Â«Now I'll read out loud "How To Build Your First GatsbyJS Function" from the "Lilly's WorkBook" you got from the far future. And you'll write the last lines of the code of your TimeShip.Â» Says Lizabeth, while Ruby hammers away on her keyboard like a wild woodpecker.

Â«But, but....Â» Says Lizabeth.

Â«Sooon, dooone.Â» Says Ruby.

Â«I haven't even STARTED reading yet....Â» Says Lizabeth.

Â«MoooHa-Ha-HA-A! Done!Â» Says Ruby, stuffing computer and keboard into her little green backpack.

Â«But.... how did you know....Â» Says Lizabeth.

Â«Know-schmow, people don't call me Ruby Reckless for no reason. I just guessed. Now move!Â» Says Ruby over her shoulder as she climbs as an ape along the next-door rooftop.

Â«Oh NO! You don't fool me again, you cheater! You piratically practiced programming on paper again, didn't you?Â» Shouts Lizabeth.

Â«NEVER!Â» Ruby shouts back.

Â«Argh! Well I guess nobody is better suited to show us if this Gatsby Function works than our neighbour and friend Freddie Catsby, his glamorous self.Â» Says Lizabeth and climbs after Ruby.

Lizabeth and Ruby climb along a few rooftops and knock on Freddie Catsby's glamorously gilded door.

Â«Hello again my beauties!Â» Says Freddie Catsby with a toothy smile under his piratical mustache.

Â«Iiiiin the mooorning Mr Catsby here is your coffee sir, can you please show us if our Gatsby function is working?Â» Ruby asks with a deep courtsey.

Â«Yes it would be my pleasure, please show me your code.Â» Says Freddie Catsby.

Â«Ok. Here it is in the yellow box.Â» Says Ruby

Â«Good. Good. And look here is your "Help me pirate Princess! You are my only hope" in localhost, but what is your first step to add a pirate Princess to your Gatsby function?Â» Asks Freddie Catsby.


( // #1 email ends)
( // #2 email starts)

Â«Our first step to add a pirate Princess is a variable.Â» Says Lizabeth.

Â«Agreed. A pirate Princess variable with an object inside it. Like this.Â» Says Ruby.

Â«A good start indeed and now a riddle about who can help you use your pirate Princess variable inside your res-cat. Ready for the riddle?Â» Says Freddie Catsby.

Â«Ready!Â» Says Ruby and Lizabeth.

Â«Who was piratical rockstar-as-a-youngster and even has an API named after him?Â» Asks Freddie Catsby.

Â«Youuu...?Â» Says Lizabeth.

Â«Nooo....Â» Says Freddie Catsby.

**Pirates, Rum and Song!**
All based on Ruby's bloody struggles to build a TimeShip of Gatsby Functions to save sister Princess Lizabeth's life and liberty from Murderous Queen Mary and her Master Spy Fulvia "The Fox" Renard. Ruby gets help from glamourous Freddie Catsby and traitourous Billy Goatsby, piratical half brothers. Cannons will boom, Towers will burn and Rum will flow.
