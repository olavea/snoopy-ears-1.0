Lizabeth and Ruby climb along a few rooftops and knock on Freddie Catsby's glamorously gilded door.

«Hello again my beauties!» Says Freddie Catsby with a toothy smile under his piratical mustache.

«Iiiiin the mooorning Mr Catsby here is your coffee and cat sir, can you please show us if our Gatsby function is working?» Ruby asks with a deep courtsey.

«Yes it would be my pleasure, please show me your code.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ok. Here it is in the yellow box.» Says Ruby

«Good. Good. And look here is your "

http://localhost:8000/api/time-travel

localhost, but what is your next task?» Asks Freddie Catsby.

«We need to get our landing location from the TimeShip browser bar and into our GatsbyJS function.» Says Lizabeth

«Are you ready for a riddle about who can help you get your landing location from your TimeShip browser bar and into our GatsbyJS function?» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ready!» Says Ruby and Lizabeth.

«Who do you know who has a green bird and a yellow book?» Asks Freddie Catsby.

«That Serverless Handbook Captain with the parrot!? Kiwi! I love Kiwi! He's so cheeky.» Says Ruby climbing along the rooftops.

«Aha! Captain Swizec!» Says Lizabeth.

«Good guessing you beautiful people! And Elizabeth, I do hope to see you both at my midnight show beneath the Clock Tower, you know the one? Please stay out of trouble with with your big sisters spies.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«I promise I'll be there, but maybe behind the prison bars. He-He!» Jokes Lizabeth.

«Ho-Ho! If you are behind the prison bars, I'll write a jail break into my show. You will need that TimeShip then to get safely away. Your sister Mary will stop at nothing to get you back in.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«It was just a joke Freddie! Mary will never dare to put me in The Tower of London where my dear mother sat before her head was chopped off. The Londoners will get too angry, Mary will never dare.» Says Lizabeth.

«Oh, she'll dare, the question is only when Mary will dare. Be blazingly fast with that TimeShip building my dear. I worry for you» Says Freddie Catsby.

A long time ago on a bridge
far, far away….

RUBY’S
TiMESHiP 4

IT'S A GREAT GATSBY FUNCTION

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge, where
we start our story.

Sunny summer is coming, but
the sneakiest sister is secretly
on the verge of starting up a civil war.
A civil war that can be blamed on
her half sisters and all the other
front end engineers.

Ruby Reckless, the youngest
half sister suspects nothing,
before seeing her beloved sister
Lizabeth loose laughter and liberty
for her front end engineering ways.

Ruby recklessly runs
duct taped code and
escapes alone to the far future and
teams up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess.

To learn the real ropes of
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comback in 1554

But when the
Tower of London
jail break fails
in flames
Ruby must learn to
LiVE code.
A great Gatsby function,
must work
before Lizabeth is beheaded.

Or Ruby will fail to stop
half sister Queen
murderous Mary from
re-building London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.
And replace all the
nice neighbours with
bad back end engineers

«Now I'll read out loud "How To Build Your First GatsbyJS Function" from the "Lilly's WorkBook" you got from the far future. And you'll write the last lines of the code of your TimeShip.» Says Lizabeth, while Ruby hammers away on her keyboard like a wild woodpecker.

«But, but....» Says Lizabeth.

«Sooon, dooone.» Says Ruby.

«I haven't even STARTED reading yet....» Says Lizabeth.

«MoooHa-Ha-HA-A! Done!» Says Ruby, stuffing computer and keyboard into her little green backpack.

«But.... how did you know....» Says Lizabeth.

«Know-schmow, people don't call me Ruby Reckless for no reason. I just guessed. Now move!» Says Ruby over her shoulder as she climbs as an ape along the next-door rooftop.

«Oh NO! You don't fool me again, you cheater! You piratically practiced programming on paper again, didn't you?» Shouts Lizabeth.

«NEVER!» Ruby shouts back.

«Argh! Well I guess nobody is better suited to show us if this Gatsby Function works than our neighbour and friend Freddie Catsby, his glamorous self.» Says Lizabeth and climbs after Ruby.

«Yes it would be my pleasure, please show me your code.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ok. Here it is in the yellow box.» Says Ruby

«Good. Good. And look here is your "Help me pirate Princess! You are my only hope" in localhost, but what is your first step to add a pirate Princess to your Gatsby function?» Asks Freddie Catsby.


( // #1 email ends)

«Our first step to add a pirate Princess is a variable.» Says Lizabeth.

«Agreed. A pirate Princess variable with an object inside it. Like this.» Says Ruby.

«A good start indeed and now a riddle about who can help you use your pirate Princess variable inside your res-cat. Ready for the riddle?» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ready!» Says Ruby and Lizabeth.

«Who was piratical rockstar-as-a-youngster and even has an API named after him?» Asks Freddie Catsby.

«Youuu...?» Says Lizabeth.

«Nooo....» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Aha! Captain Json Placeholder!» Says Ruby, typing away and shows Catsby.

 ( // codesnippet)

«Excellent, now your next step is to fetch the adress you want your TimeShip to land. Ask Json Placeholder to help you. See you at my show laters alligators.» Freddie Catsby smiles with white teeth and waves his tricorn hat. Ruby and Lizabeth climb along the rooftops.

«Boop! Captain Json Placeholder, can you please help us to fetch this LandingAdress?» Says Lizabeth.

«YARR! Anything I can do to help.»
Captain Json Placeholder smiles in his big purple beard and sticks his arm far into the API treasure trove.

«I hope you young ladies don't mind me offering you one piece of piratical advice. I see Queen Mary's super spy coming onto our bridge down there. Don't let her see you out of your house arrest or she will find a way to clap you both in cold irons in the Tower. YARR! Here it is! The LandingAdress you young ladies wanted. Show my how you will use it.» Captain Json Placeholder pulls the shiny LandingAdress out of the API.

 ( // codesnippet)

«Good work. What more do you need to get your TimeShip into production?» Says Captain Json Placeholder.

«A LandingDate with a heart of gold.» Says Lizabeth.

«How do you find the date with a heart of gold among all the glittery treasures in This Toothy Treasure Chest of WordPress Data?» Says Captain Json Placeholder.

«With a query.» Says Lizabeth.

«A GraphQL query.» Says Ruby.

«And who do you know who has a chapter on GraphQL in his yellow serverless book?» Asks Captain Json Placeholder.

«That Serverless Handbook guy with the parrot? Kiwi! I love Kiwi!» Says Lizabeth.

«Aha! Swizec Dollarid!» Says Ruby climbing along the rooftops.

«Good guessing! Here Lizabeth, you grab GraphQL. See you soon at Catsby's Crazy Show.» Says Captain Json Placeholder

«Oi! Swizec Dollarid! Can you please help us grab the date with a heart of gold on the wpPost node? Just like you grabbed Ruby's arm when she bicycled by you yesterday and almost fell clean off of the bridge and into the river?» Says Lizabeth

Swizec Dollarid digs in the glittery gold behind the sharky-sharp teeth.

«Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of RUM! Here is the date with a heart of gold.» Says Swizec Dollarid

«Thousand thanks! Ok Ruby, write your query.» Says Lizabeth

 ( // codesnippet)

«Let me see please. Yes that will work, but ride responsibly. NOT like you rode your bike yesterday, ok?! See you at the Catsby Concert!» Says Swizec Dollarid with a wink and a hat tip.

«Concert! Catsby Concert!» Croaks Kiwi.
