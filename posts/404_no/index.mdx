These are messy notes on hpw I set up a 404 page for POW! a webapp built with GatsbyJS And React

issue:
Why is unknown pages not redirected to the gatsby 404 page #51
I thought it was because the gatsby netlify plugin was not installed, but it is.

Is the custom header settings the problem?


Step 1
A custom 404 page wasn't detected
// 365DaysOfPOWprogramming-day-131_fix_404_page_#51-341.jpg
I try to make a 404.js in pages and see what happens
ðŸ˜¸

```js
import React from "react"
import {Link} from "gatsby"

const KrakenPage = () => {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>You better get back aboard POW! because ... the Kraken.</h1>
        <Link to="/timeline">Go to timeline</Link>
      </>
    )
}

export default KrakenPage;

```

Step 2
Questions
Â«What kind of styling do you want?
Do you want an image of a kraken that our intern Lillian (6 ðŸ¦„ ) has drawn?
raae/nattermob.dev#3

Or maybe I shouldn't do any styling?.Â» Says Ola.

Â«suggestion: Wrap in a `AppAuthLayout` to get the correct design.
Make sure to use the prop `title` and set to `"Not found"`.
You will need to import `AppAuthLayout` from `../features/app`.

Â«chore (non-blocking): If you feel like it, rename the AppAuthLayout component AppMinimalLayout.
Make sure you do this as the absolute last step after getting everything else working.Â» Says Benedicte @raae.

I tried the AppMinimalLayout thing, and it didn't work, but I will try it again tomorrow
ðŸ˜¸Â» And then three days later Â«I changed my mind, can I do this AppMinimalLayout thing some other time?.Â» Says Ola Vea.

```
    return (
      <>
        <h1>You better get back aboard POW! because ... the Kraken.</h1>
        <Link to="/timeline">Go to timeline</Link>
```
@raae:
**suggestion:** Remove as some users are not logged in.
**suggestion:** Replace `h1` with `p`.
**suggestion:** Make "POW!" a link to `HOME.to`
You need to import HOME from `../features/navigation`
**nitpick:** Make copy less Nattermob and more POW!
POW! is about taking charge, comic book, super hero stuff.
**nitpick:** This one should be named NotFoundPage
The reason it's important to name things what they are is if someone comes in and gets an error it should make sense to them as well.



@olavea
warn "export 'default' (imported as 'HOME') was not found in '../features/navigation'
also
warn "export 'default' (imported as 'HOME') was not found in '../features/navigation/navItems'
// 365DaysOfPOWprogramming-day-132_fix_404_page_#51_(#269)_Not_found_#-346.jpg


@raae
It is a named export so you need `import {HOME} from "../features/navigation/"`

@olavea
ðŸ˜º
YESSS!
`{HOME}` worked!
POW! POW! POW!
ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’¥

@raae
**nitpick:** Make copy less Nattermob and more POW!
POW! is about taking charge, comic book, super hero stuff.

@olavea
Now it is
<p>Nothing to see here, <a href={HOME.to}>Go back to POW!</a></p>

```js
 return (
      <>
        <AppAuthLayout title="Not Found">

            <p>Jump in my old school batmobile and I'll give you a ride to my beauuuuutiful mansion for some good old fashioned fun.</p>
            <p>Jump in my old school batmobile and I'll give you a ride to my beauuuuutiful mansion for some good old fashioned fun. Or....</p

            ```

@raae
This makes no sense without the image.

I want the first version of this to be boring, but working page.
Let me know if I should do the copy @olavea.

You can go all out in #273, but it has to be on brand and I might never approve it.


@olavea
That's ok.
ðŸ˜º
look at the [comment above](https://github.com/raae/pow-app/pull/269#discussion_r629935885)

I just needed to make a drawing after the coding, you know:

An I have put some more links to batman LEGO photos from unsplash  in #273

@olavea
Question 1
When I merge, should I write:
// 365DaysOfPOWprogramming-day-131_coomit-342.jpg

Question 2
Should I not update branch first?

"fix: 404 page #51 (#269)" here?

@raae
Yes you should, then squash.

Confirm squash and merge
fix: 404 page, closes #51
* fix: 404 page #51 (#268 )

* Will keep working tomorrow #51 (#269)

* named import & <a href={HOME.to}> #51

* It works locally, but ... #51 (#269)
