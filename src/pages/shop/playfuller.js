      <h2>Not Sure How Your Coding Practice Can Get Better?</h2>
      <p>You are improving your coding skills, but maybe you suspect you could be practicing better? What does «better» practice even look like for YOU? Maybe you ARE practicing «better» sometimes without even knowing it?

      This can be frustrating. Maybe IS frustrating? And adding to your other work life frustrations?

      Buuuut at the same time «better» practice should be an exciting challenge for you, because you are a dev. Don’t pretend you don’t feel that expectation. Here you are, getting paid to write code AND getting paid to practice coding, but you know your coding  practice could be «better». Should be «better».

      Ok, one thing at the time. Let’s forget the frustration-part of «better» practice and focus on the exciting challenge-part of «better» coding practice. You have a tall wall of «better» coding practice in front of you and it looks un-climbeable. Smoothly un-climbeable, where are the handholds? Where are the footholds? Where do you even START climbing to get «better» practicing coding.
      </p>
