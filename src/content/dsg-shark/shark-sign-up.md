## Not sure how to try DSG? Or why?
DSG, SSG, what's with these acronyms away?

## The Darker DSG-truth
Well, what if the DSG-truth was darker than your darkest dreams? What if you could tell the DSG-story in a way a 6-year-old would remember? Every night, before going to sleep? 🦈 🏴‍☠️ Just kidding. There are ryhmes in there, ryhmes with bunny and kitten. And in the end nobody gets bitten. Maybe. There will be coloring pages and a gingerbread recipe that tastes like.... ginger. A ginger taste as sharp as sharks teeth.
